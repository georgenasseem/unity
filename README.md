# Unity
#### Scratch started my love for games and I continued it with unity. I wanted to start unity a long while ago, but I postponed it until I get more experince with coding. I took 8 cources in unity and it was amazing. I will list down below my projects from my least favorite to my most favorite. I eill also be linking my cource certificates ubove.

## Starting projects: These projects are very baisic and I did while learning baisics, they are not the best quality and I didnt spent a lot of time on them.

## Normal projects: These projects are better than the last ones, they are the projects that tok my alot of time to make, but I wouldnt say they were my favotite.
